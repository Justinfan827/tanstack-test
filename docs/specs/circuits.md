# Circuits

I want to support circuits in my grid.

Users should be able to add rows that are either an exercise,
or be able to add a new circuit.

The agent should also be able to consider sets and have tools to create 'sets' i.e. rows that are part of a circuit.


I need help with:
1. data modelling
2. how to represent this in the grid
3. how mutations will work


read thi spec.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious
